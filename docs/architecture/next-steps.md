## Next Steps
- Review this architecture with Product Owner and QA for alignment on tech stack, data models, and security mandates.
- Spin up repo skeleton (`apps/*`, `packages/*`, Compose stack) and commit baseline configuration files.
- Generate Prisma schema and migrations from the documented DDL; connect to CI for migration checks.
- Implement authentication + connector onboarding stories first (foundation for all other flows).
- Coordinate with Frontend Architect using this document as input for UI architecture.
- Prepare GitHub Actions workflow and Docker Compose overrides for staging/production deployments.
