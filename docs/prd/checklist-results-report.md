## Critical Deficiencies
- None identified for MVP planning readiness.

## Recommendations
- UI/UX build readiness (P1):
  - Add shadcn UI and Tailwind presets to the web app; create 1–2 baseline components and Ladle stories.
  - Add performance checks to CI (Lighthouse or Playwright trace budgets) aligned to documented budgets.
- Observability refinements (P2):
  - Implement alert thresholds and SLOs from Epic 4; add queue depth metric and connector failure counters early.
- Provider quotas doc (P2):
  - Add direct links to Google Calendar and Microsoft Graph quota documentation in the PRD and error handling strategy.

## Final Decision
APPROVED — The plan is comprehensive, properly sequenced, and ready for implementation. Remaining PARTIALs are documentation- or scaffold-adjacent and will close as code is introduced.

## Skipped Sections
- All Brownfield-only checklist items were skipped as this is a Greenfield project.
