# Story
As an administrator,
I want a dashboard layout with navigation scaffolding,
so that I can reach connector, calendar, and settings areas.

# Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard renders status tiles (placeholders for connectors, sync jobs, alerts) using ShadCN components with light/dark mode support.
2. Navigation includes Dashboard, Connectors, Calendars, Logs, and Settings links (non-functional stubs allowed initially).
3. Unified calendar panel placeholder displays instructional text when no calendars are connected.
4. Layout is responsive down to 768px width and meets WCAG AA contrast targets in both themes.

# Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Route and layout scaffold (AC: 1, 2, 3)

# Dev Notes
- Previous Story Insights
  - 1.2 (Local Admin Authentication) enforces auth-gated portal access; ensure the shell and nav only render for authenticated sessions and redirect unauthenticated users to `/login` [Source: docs/architecture/security.md; docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/auth/session]

- Data Models
  - No specific data models required for initial shell and placeholders (counts/statistics will be wired later) [Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

- API Specifications
  - None required for initial stubs; future wiring will consume metrics and domain endpoints [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]

- Component/Service Specifications
  - Dashboard tiles use `StatusCard`; include placeholder props and a11y labels [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Component Inventory]
  - Unified calendar panel renders an empty state message when no calendars exist [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Wireframe Notes]
  - Sidebar/bottom-sheet navigation provides links to primary areas; maintain breadcrumb strategy in detail views (future) [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Information Architecture (IA)]
  - Layout & responsiveness: Desktop shows three status cards on top with calendar + timeline columns; below 1024px content stacks vertically and sidebar collapses to a bottom sheet/hamburger with keyboard support [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Screen Specifications; docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Responsiveness Strategy]

- File Locations
  - App Router pages: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`, `(connectors)/page.tsx`, `(calendars)/page.tsx`, `(logs)/page.tsx`, `(settings)/page.tsx`; shared shell in `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
  - Shared UI primitives exported from `packages/ui/src` (theme provider/toggle, status card) and consumed by portal shell [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]

- Testing Requirements
  - Follow Playwright for portal E2E; integrate axe scans on key pages; maintain keyboard navigation order and visible focus outlines [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md; docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]

- Technical Constraints
  - Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind 4.x, ShadCN 3.x [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
  - Performance budgets and code-splitting practices for heavier panels (lazy) [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-build-and-assets.md]

- Project Structure Notes
  - Shared UI primitives live in `packages/ui`; sync with architecture before introducing new shared components [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md; docs/architecture/components.md]

## Testing
- E2E (Playwright):
  - With an authenticated session, dashboard renders three status tiles and primary nav links; unauthenticated users redirect to `/login` [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Information Architecture (IA); docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
  - At 768px viewport width, layout remains usable and nav control is accessible by keyboard [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Responsiveness Strategy; docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]
  - Axe-core scan on dashboard shows no critical violations; focus outlines visible for interactive elements [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]

# Dev Agent Record
## Agent Model Used
- Codex (GPT-5)

## Debug Log References
- `npm run test:e2e --workspace @syncal/web -- --list` (suite discovery; full run pending seeded admin creds)
- `npm run build --workspace @syncal/web` (passes)
- `npm test` (vitest --run across workspaces)

## Completion Notes List
- Implemented responsive app shell with desktop sidebar, mobile bottom-sheet navigation, skip link, and theme toggle per IA and accessibility specs.
- Added dashboard placeholders: status cards, unified calendar guidance, sync timeline teaser, and stub pages for connectors/calendars/logs/settings.
- Refactored dashboard metrics to wrap shared ShadCN `Card` primitives via `packages/ui` and exported the helper `StatusCard` for reuse.
- Extended Playwright coverage for unified calendar empty state, tablet breakpoint behaviour, and theme toggle; suite discovery invoked pending seeded admin credentials.
- Hardened theme provider to avoid server/client hydration mismatches when resolving system preferences.
- Established `packages/ui` workspace for shared primitives; portal imports the theme provider/toggle and status card from there.
- Updated Tailwind/PostCSS wiring to use `@tailwindcss/postcss`, matching Tailwind 4 requirements for dev and build parity.
- Reworked `AppShell` to bypass navigation chrome on `/login`, keeping auth views outside the dashboard frame and aligned with Story 1.2 guard expectations.
- Secured the login redirect by validating `from` parameters, invoking `router.refresh()`, and ensuring a fallback reload so admins land on the portal after successful sign-in.
- Hardened middleware session validation to try the internal API hostname when the browser-exposed base URL is unreachable (e.g., Docker localhost).
- Exposed `AUTH_SESSION_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` (default 25 outside production) so automated runs no longer trip the login throttler; DELETE logout now mirrors the login fallback when client-side navigation fails.
- Added a media-query aware `AppShell` render path so the desktop sidebar only mounts on â‰¥1024px viewports; mobile nav trigger and dialog manage focus and visibility for tablet widths.

# QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-20
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
- Portal shell structure and accessibility affordances (skip link, aria labelling) look solid, but responsive breakpoint logic and component library adherence need correction.

### Test Coverage Review
- Only Playwright specs are present; planned unit/integration coverage and dark-theme assertions were not implemented. Latest Playwright run executed but skipped all scenarios due to missing admin credentials, so no acceptance coverage was actually verified.

### Findings
- **FAIL** â€“ 768px viewport still renders the desktop sidebar while hiding the mobile trigger, so the "collapse to sheet" requirement is unmet (AC4). Tailwind breakpoints use `md` (`min-width:768px`), so `DesktopSidebar` stays visible and the hamburger is hidden exactly where AC4 expects the collapse (`apps/web/src/components/app-shell.tsx:190`, `apps/web/src/components/app-shell.tsx:223`).
- **FAIL** â€“ Status tiles are hand-rolled divs instead of ShadCN primitives, violating AC1's explicit "using ShadCN components" directive. `StatusCard` exports custom markup and does not wrap ShadCN's `Card`/tokens as required (`packages/ui/src/dashboard/status-card.tsx:1`).
- **CONCERNS** â€“ Planned coverage for unified calendar empty state, theme toggling, and navigation config is missing (no unit/integration suites, and Playwright specs only partially match the trace). See expectations in `docs/qa/assessments/1.3-test-design-20250919.md` versus actual `apps/web/tests/e2e/*.spec.ts`.

### Recommendations
- Replace the custom cards with ShadCN `Card` (or wrap it in `StatusCard`) so the dashboard uses the approved component library.
- Adjust responsive classes so the sidebar hides and the sheet trigger shows at `<=768px` (e.g., move sidebar display to `lg:flex` and keep the hamburger visible through `md`). Add an E2E assertion at exactly 768px.
- Backfill the planned unit/integration tests plus Playwright coverage for the unified calendar empty state and dark-theme toggle.

### Suggested Status
- Changes Required â€“ blocking issues remain for AC1 and AC4.

### Notes
- Playwright suite could not finish locally (`npm run test:e2e --workspace @syncal/web` fails due to Chromium sandbox limits). Please supply a recorded run from CI or a local environment with browsers available after addressing blockers.
