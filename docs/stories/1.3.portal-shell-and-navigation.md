# Story
As an administrator,
I want a dashboard layout with navigation scaffolding,
so that I can reach connector, calendar, and settings areas.

# Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard renders status tiles (placeholders for connectors, sync jobs, alerts) using ShadCN components with light/dark mode support.
2. Navigation includes Dashboard, Connectors, Calendars, Logs, and Settings links (non-functional stubs allowed initially).
3. Unified calendar panel placeholder displays instructional text when no calendars are connected.
4. Layout is responsive down to 768px width and meets WCAG AA contrast targets in both themes.

# Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Route and layout scaffold (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create portal shell using Next.js App Router with grouped routes: `(dashboard)`, `(connectors)`, `(calendars)`, `(logs)`, `(settings)` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
  - [ ] Add top-level `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` to provide page chrome (header/sidebar), theme provider, and main container [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Information Architecture (IA); docs/architecture/frontend-build-and-assets.md]
  - [ ] Create pages: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`, `(connectors)/page.tsx`, `(calendars)/page.tsx`, `(logs)/page.tsx`, `(settings)/page.tsx` with initial stub content [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
  - [ ] Ensure unauthenticated users are redirected to `/login` and shell renders only after auth (uses guard from Story 1.2) [Source: docs/architecture/security.md; docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md]

- [ ] Dashboard status tiles + placeholders (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Implement `StatusCard` component and render three tiles: Calendars Synced, Connectors Healthy, Active Alerts (placeholder numbers) [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Component Inventory]
  - [ ] Add Unified Calendar placeholder panel with instructional empty state when no calendars are connected [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Wireframe Notes]
  - [ ] Reserve area for Sync Timeline (lazy-load later) with non-blocking placeholder [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-build-and-assets.md#Code Splitting & Lazy Loading]

- [ ] Navigation scaffold (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Add sidebar navigation with links to Dashboard, Connectors, Calendars, Logs, Settings (use accessible list and link semantics) [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Information Architecture (IA)]
  - [ ] On mobile/tablet, collapse sidebar into burger/bottom sheet; ensure keyboard accessibility [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Responsiveness Strategy; docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]

- [ ] Theming and accessibility (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Configure light/dark theme support for ShadCN components; add theme toggle control in header [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Design Principles; docs/architecture/components.md]
  - [ ] Ensure WCAG AA contrast for text and interactive elements; add visible focus styles and skip link [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]

- [ ] Responsiveness and layout (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Use responsive grid/flex layouts per breakpoints; verify 768px tablet layout for navigation and tiles [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Responsiveness Strategy]

- [ ] Structure & repos alignment
  - [ ] Place portal files under `apps/web/src/app/*` and components under `apps/web/src/components/*` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
  - [ ] Use shared UI primitives when `packages/ui` lands; for now, local components are acceptable [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md; docs/architecture/components.md]

- [ ] Tests (Playwright + a11y) (AC: 1â€“4)
  - [ ] E2E: Authenticated session sees nav links (Dashboard, Connectors, Calendars, Logs, Settings) and three status tiles [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Information Architecture (IA); docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
  - [ ] Responsive: At 768px width, sidebar collapses appropriately and content remains usable [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Responsiveness Strategy]
  - [ ] Accessibility: Run axe-core on dashboard and ensure no critical violations; focus order traverses nav then main content [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements; docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

# Dev Notes
- Previous Story Insights
  - 1.2 (Local Admin Authentication) enforces auth-gated portal access; ensure the shell and nav only render for authenticated sessions and redirect unauthenticated users to `/login` [Source: docs/architecture/security.md; docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/auth/session]

- Data Models
  - No specific data models required for initial shell and placeholders (counts/statistics will be wired later) [Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

- API Specifications
  - None required for initial stubs; future wiring will consume metrics and domain endpoints [Source: docs/architecture/components.md]

- Component/Service Specifications
  - Dashboard tiles use `StatusCard`; include placeholder props and a11y labels [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Component Inventory]
  - Unified calendar panel renders an empty state message when no calendars exist [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Wireframe Notes]
  - Sidebar/bottom-sheet navigation provides links to primary areas; maintain breadcrumb strategy in detail views (future) [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Information Architecture (IA)]

- File Locations
  - App Router pages: `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`, `(connectors)/page.tsx`, `(calendars)/page.tsx`, `(logs)/page.tsx`, `(settings)/page.tsx`; shared shell in `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
  - UI components: `apps/web/src/components/StatusCard.tsx`, `apps/web/src/components/NavSidebar.tsx`, etc. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

- Testing Requirements
  - Follow Playwright for portal E2E; integrate axe scans on key pages; maintain keyboard navigation order and visible focus outlines [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md; docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]

- Technical Constraints
  - Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind 4.x, ShadCN 3.x [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
  - Performance budgets and code-splitting practices for heavier panels (lazy) [Source: docs/architecture/frontend-build-and-assets.md]

- Project Structure Notes
  - If `packages/ui` is not yet available, keep UI primitives local to `apps/web` and refactor later to shared package [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

## Testing
- E2E (Playwright):
  - With an authenticated session, dashboard renders three status tiles and primary nav links; unauthenticated users redirect to `/login` [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Information Architecture (IA); docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
  - At 768px viewport width, layout remains usable and nav control is accessible by keyboard [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Responsiveness Strategy; docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]
  - Axe-core scan on dashboard shows no critical violations; focus outlines visible for interactive elements [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md#Accessibility Requirements]
