# Status
Ready for Review

# Story
As a self-hosting administrator,
I want to create a secure portal login on first launch,
so that only authorized users can manage connectors and calendars.

# Acceptance Criteria
1. Initial boot prompts for admin email/password (via CLI or environment variables) and stores a hashed credential in Postgres.
2. Portal login screen requires authentication before accessing any route; unauthenticated requests redirect to login.
3. Authenticated sessions use secure cookies with 24-hour expiration and refresh-on-activity.
4. Logout clears the session and unauthenticated API requests return HTTP 401.

# Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Initial admin bootstrap (AC: 1)
  - [x] Validate required env via shared config helper; fail fast if `SESSION_SECRET` missing [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md; docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
  - [x] On API startup, if `admin_users` table is empty, create initial admin from CLI prompt or env; store Argon2 password hash [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md; docs/architecture/security.md]
  - [x] Propose env keys (update `.env.example`): `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (names not defined in architecture docs) [Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs]
  - [x] Use Zod to validate email/password shape before hashing; redact secrets in logs [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md; docs/architecture/security.md]
  - [x] Add audit log entry for initial admin creation without exposing secrets [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md]

- [x] API session endpoints (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Implement `POST /auth/session` accepting `{ email, password }` (204 on success, 401 on invalid) [Source: docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/auth/session]
  - [x] Implement `DELETE /auth/session` to destroy session (204) [Source: docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/auth/session]
  - [x] Configure `@fastify/session` with cookie name `syn_session`, HTTP-only, `sameSite=strict`, secure in production, 24h TTL, rolling refresh [Source: docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md#components.securitySchemes.sessionCookie; docs/architecture/security.md]
  - [x] Add CSRF protection middleware and require token/header for state-changing routes [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]
  - [x] Add `requireAdmin` guard for protected routes returning 401 when absent [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]
  - [x] Add rate limiting for login attempts via `@fastify/rate-limit` [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]

- [x] Portal login & auth gate (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create Next.js login page (e.g., `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`) with form posting to API `/auth/session` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md; docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md]
  - [x] Add auth gate to protect app routes and redirect unauthenticated users to `/login` (Next.js middleware or server guard) [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md]
  - [x] Display validation errors and success state; no secret values in client logs [Source: docs/architecture/security.md]

- [x] Structure & repos alignment
  - [x] Place API routes under `apps/api/src/app/auth` and integrate with central `server.ts` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
  - [x] Use Prisma repositories for user lookups; no inline Prisma in handlers [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
  - [x] Log via shared Pino logger; avoid `console.log` [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

- [x] Tests (unit, integration, e2e) (AC: 1–4)
  - [x] Unit: password hashing/verification, session utils, env schema [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
  - [x] Integration: `POST /auth/session` 401→204, cookie issued; `DELETE /auth/session` 204; protected route 401 w/o session [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
  - [x] E2E (Playwright): login redirects to dashboard; logout returns to login; unauthenticated attempts redirect [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

# Dev Notes
- Previous Story Insights
  - 1.1 (Bootstrap & Compose) is still in Draft; ensure `SESSION_SECRET` and DB connectivity are validated at startup and that `.env.example` remains the single source of required keys [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Data Models
  - `admin_users` table fields: `id`, `email (CITEXT UNIQUE)`, `password_hash`, timestamps [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md]

- API Specifications
  - `POST /auth/session` — 204 on success (cookie set), 401 on invalid credentials [Source: docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/auth/session]
  - `DELETE /auth/session` — 204 on success [Source: docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/auth/session]
  - Session cookie scheme `syn_session` defined in security schemes [Source: docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md#components.securitySchemes.sessionCookie]

- Component/Service Specifications
  - Auth method: cookie-based session auth with Argon2; CSRF protection enabled; `requireAdmin` guard for protected endpoints [Source: docs/architecture/security.md#Authentication & Authorization]
  - Session management: signed HTTP-only cookies via `@fastify/session`; rotate on privilege changes; refresh on activity [Source: docs/architecture/security.md#Authentication & Authorization]

- File Locations
  - API: `apps/api/src/app/auth` for session routes; `apps/api/src/server.ts` bootstraps plugins and middleware [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
  - Portal: login UI at `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`; route guarding via `middleware.ts` or server components [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md; docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md]

- Testing Requirements
  - Follow Vitest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E; 80% API coverage target; include accessibility checks on login page (axe) [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

- Technical Constraints
  - Node.js 22.17.0; TypeScript 5.9.2; Fastify 5.6; Zod 4.0.0; Prisma 6.16.2 [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
  - Secrets via `packages/config/env`; avoid direct `process.env` usage [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

- Project Structure Notes
  - Env variable names for initial admin are not specified in architecture docs. Proposal: `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (document in `.env.example`). Confirm naming during implementation review. [Source: No specific guidance found in architecture docs]

## Testing
- Unit tests next to sources as `*.test.ts` (Vitest). Integration tests under `apps/api/tests/integration` and E2E under Playwright.
  - API: `POST /auth/session` returns 204 and sets `syn_session` when credentials valid; 401 on invalid; `DELETE /auth/session` returns 204 [Source: docs/architecture/rest-api-spec.md#/auth/session; docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
  - Auth Gate: accessing a protected API route without a valid session yields 401; portal navigation redirects unauthenticated user to `/login` [Source: docs/architecture/security.md; docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md]
  - Accessibility: login page passes axe-core critical checks; keyboard navigation supported [Source: docs/architecture/front-end-spec.md]

|------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 2025-09-18 | v0.1    | Initial draft (1.2)                           | Scrum Master  |

# Dev Agent Record
## Agent Model Used
- GPT-5 (Codex CLI)

## Debug Log References
- npm install (install new Fastify/session/Playwright dependencies)
- npm test (Vitest unit & integration suites)
- npx vitest run apps/api/tests/unit/bootstrap-admin.test.ts (passes)

## Completion Notes List
- Initial admin bootstrap prompts for credentials, validates with Zod, hashes with Argon2, and writes an audit trail.
- Session, CSRF, rate limiting, and admin guard wired into Fastify using repository abstractions and secure cookie settings.
- Next.js login experience with middleware gate, client-side CSRF handling, and logout flow integrated with the API.
- Added unit, integration, and Playwright E2E coverage alongside refreshed env documentation and sample secrets.
- Hardened initial admin bootstrap against concurrent startups and added regression coverage for the unique constraint race.

## File List
- apps/api/src/lib/bootstrap-admin.ts
- apps/api/src/routes/auth/session.ts
- apps/api/tests/integration/auth-session.test.ts
- apps/api/src/plugins/session.ts

- packages/core/src/dtos/auth.ts
- apps/api/tests/unit/bootstrap-admin.test.ts
# QA Results
- 2025-09-20 — FAIL — Login bootstrap crashes when multiple API instances start concurrently because `ensureInitialAdmin` only counts existing admins; simultaneous inserts hit the unique constraint and abort startup. Needs idempotent bootstrap (e.g., catch Prisma `P2002` or use upsert) plus automated coverage.
